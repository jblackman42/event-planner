    "Prayer Request": "Dear friends,\n\nThank you from all my heart for your prayers for me and my family in Ukraine. I was able to talk to them today. Glory to God, they are safe after another severe bombings last night. Probably the poisonous chemicals were used again in bombs because my brother Michael has severe nose nose bleedings, his wife Angela's kidney inflammation is worse, their son Eugene's wound on his right leg is worse. Their friend Vadim is in excruciating pain whose right side of the body got paralyzed after working outside all day. My family is running out of donated money. My fundraiser is struggling to get contributions. The most horrifying news is that Russians are advancing on the regions around my family. Bakhmut and Avdiinka are strategic points in winning war for Ukraine now. Avdiivka is greater because it's a key point to take Bakhmut. Every day more than 1,000 soldiers are killed there. Only God can save them and the river dam, which very close to them. Please continue your powerful prayers for safety of the river dam, my family's safety, for Michael's complete cure from nose bleedings, Angela's complete kidney healing, for Eugene's wounds healing and to find a better job, money to survive, keep their apartment, and for my fundraiser get donations to help them, stop Russian attacks, and peace in Ukraine.  Please, special prayer to save Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut and Avdiivka Cities until Ukrainian troops start counter-offence in the middle of April (they can't start now due to the shortage of weapons). A prayer for me too, please, because I have been feeling very ill due to my kidneys' work only 37% and severe inflammation in my body and friend Vadim whose right side of the body got paralyzed after the bombing in Ukraine.\n\nPraying for you and your family's safety and wellness. May God shower all of you with abundant blessings endlessly.\n\nHave a blessed week. \n\nTatyana.\n\nPrayer list: Michael, Angela, Eugene, Vadim, (Andrew, Alex B, Alex N, Ivan-soldiers), Tatyana, Olga, Dmitry, Vova, Nataya, Nikolay.\n\n"
